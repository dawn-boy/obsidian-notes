## function
- data processing
- data storage
	- Long term
	- short term
- data movement
	- Data moves through long distance is called data communication
- control
	- manages PC resources
	- Coordinates the system registers when instructions are given
## structure
4 main structural components
- CPU
- Main memory
- I/O
	Anything connected to system from the outside 
- system interconnection
	Communication by the means of system bus
## bus
- control bus
	Carries control signals 
- address bus
	Carries memory address
- system bus

## top level structure 
- System
	- I/O
	- Main memory 
	- System bus
	- CPU
		- Registers
		- ALU
		- Internal bus
		- Control unit
			- sequencing logic
			- registers and decoders
			- control memory

## chip
A chip is a single piece of semiconducting material that is typically silicon.
## integrated circuit
Upon a silicon chip, the electric circuits and logic gates are built, this is called a integrated circuit 
## instruction logic
It deals with fetching instructions and decoding each of them. Also deals with memory location 
## arithmetic and logic unit
Performs operations given by an instruction 
## load/store logic
Transfers the data to and from main memory via cache
## cache memory 
The fast, temporary storage between CPU and main memory 
***
# Von-neumann
- designed a new storage program computer in 1946, same memory used to store both data and program 
- Fixed program computer
	- very specific and rigid can't reprogram
- Stored program computer
	- programmed to carry out difference tasks
