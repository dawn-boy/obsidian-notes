## continuos process improvement
- the continuos improvement system takes a step by step approach that is based on proven scientific methods. Continuos improvement is both a mindset and a tool. The opportunities for continuous improvement is present everywhere all around us, everyday. It's a process of taking our current learning and experience and applying it to our area of influence.
- It's a method of making small, incremental improvements to contribute to increased competitiveness, productivity, teamwork, employee, engagement, and reduced costs. It's a series of asking the same question, "how can we optimise the current process?"

### types
#### waterfall model
The waterfall system development model is sequential, multistage, system development process where development of Next stage cannot begin until the current stage results are approved or modified as necessary.
#### agile development model
It's a system which is developed in iteration lasting from one to four weeks. It focuses on teams ability to provide quick responses to emerging requirements.
### process model
- input
- process
- output
- feedback
#### understand the process model
- detecting mode
- preventing mode
- using feedback to take corrective actions so that the process can be used to continually improve the current situation
### Deming's PDSA/PDCA cycle (embedded in the continuos system)
- plan
	Define the objective, ask questions and make predictions. Plan to carry out the cycle of what, where, when, and why
- do
	Carry out the plan, document problems and unexpected observations. This stage is where the analysis of the data begins 
- study/check
	Complete the analysis of the data, compare data to the predictions made and summarise what was learnt
- act
	Do what has to be done based on the derived data, what changes are to be made? And prepare for the next cycle.
- analyze
- plan again..

#### finding a cost effective solution
- control existing process, that is statistical process control (SPC)
- optimize the process, design of experiment (DOE)
- change the system, hardware, software, and brainware
- new system, machine, human, materials, methods
- build a quality culture, positive and constructive. Drive out fear. Provide organisational structural assurance for continuous feedback system. Respond to the customer needs and solve problems timely. Standardize the procedure and continuously improve it.

## Software
### software product liability
- liability of manufactures, sellers, lessors and others for injuries caused by defective products
- if a software defect causes this, then the injured party may she the product company
#### types of product liability
- strict liability
	Defendant held responsible for injuring another person regardless of negligence or intent. Plantiff is only supposed to prove that the software product is defective or unreasonably dangerous
	- legal defence for defendant
		- doctrine of superventing
		- government contractor defense
		- expired statue of limitations 

- negligence
Failure to do what a reasonable person would do
- breach of warranty
- misrepresentation
### software testing
- black box testing
	Tester has no knowledge of code
- white box testing
	Testing all possible logic paths in software unit with thorough knowledge of the logic
### capability maturity model integration
- process improvement approach
- defines 5 levels of software maturity development.
- CMMI development is a set of guidelines for 22 process areas related to systems development
#### development of safety critical systems
- project safety engineer
- hazard log
- rigorous testing and retesting
- safety reviews
- formal documentation required
#### form of redundancy
- two machines run the same program and final results are compared to find if there are any differences, if there are then third machine runs to find which algorithm was wrong.

#### failure mode and effects analysis
- technique used to evaluate reliability and detect the effect of system and equipment failures
- types
- impact on a project success
- personnel safety
- equipment safety
- customer satisfaction and saftey
ISO 9001 is a guide to quality product, service and management
