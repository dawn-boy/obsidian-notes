# partial differential equation
- PDE is a mathematical equation that involves two or more independent variables
- the order of PDE is the highest derivative
- the degree of the PDF is the power of the highest derivative term
## solve the equation for z
$$\frac{\partial^2{z}}{\partial{x^2}} + 7 = 0$$on integrating w.r.t x,
(cux x is in the denominator and that's considered as integration)
$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} + 7x = f(y)$$
integrating again,
$$ z + \frac{7x^2}{2} = g(y) + xf(y)$$
so value of z is,
$$ z = -\frac{7x^2}{2} + g(y) + xf(y) $$
