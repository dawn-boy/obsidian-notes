**Machine Learning** is all about using **==an algorithm to find patterns==** within a data and to use those patterns in the future ==**to make predictions on similar unseen data**==
# Machine Learning Framework

## 1. Problem Definition
What problem are we trying to solve?
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Regression
- Classification
- etc...

## 2. Data 
What kind of data do we have?
- Structured data
- Unstructured data

## 3. Evaluation
What defines success to us?

# 4. Features
What do we already know about the data?
- The Training set
	to train your model on this
- The Validation set
	to tune your model on this
- The Testing set
	to test your model on this
## Generalization
The ability for a machine learning model to perform well on unseen data
# 5. Modelling
- if the data was structured data, then
	- catboost and random forest works the best
- if the data was unstructured data, then
	- deep learning and transfer learning works the best

# 6. Experimentation
