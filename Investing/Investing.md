### formulas
- book value = share capital + reserves
### look for
- ROE (return on equity)
	- Net profit / shareholder's equity 
	- says how efficient the company uses its assets to attain the profits
	- ==look for more than 15%==
- Debt to equity 
	- total debt / total shareholders equity
	- says how much debt a company has compared to its assets
	- ==look for between 1 and 1.5==
- sales growth
	- ==look for at least 10%-15% growth over the last 10 years==
	- sales growth can be non-linear in many companies, meaning that company could have had huge sales in the last few years relative to its last 10 years
	- It's also equally important to know why the sales growth has occurred, the value depends on both Volume and average ticket size.
- EPS (earnings per share)
	- total earnings / no. of shares
	- EPS is the total amount of profit made by the company that's available to each share, while dividend is the actual sum assigned to each share from the profit. 
	- a general pattern that seems to reveal in the midst of chaos is that any company the grew its eps above 15.1% over the last 10 years also had a 23.8% growth in share price.
	- ==if EPS growth is < 10% in the last 10 years, that's probably not a multibagger.==
	- ==the sweet spot is 20% - 25% in the 10 years growth==
- ROCE (return on capital employed) 
	- operating earnings / capital employed 
	- says how efficient that company is on attaining the said earnings with the capital used
	- An increasing ROCE value shows that the company is strengthening in its sector
	- ==look for more than 15%, while the previous multibaggers had an average of 23.1% over the preceding year==
- PEG Ratio
	- ==PE ratio / EPS growth rate==
	- ==According to lynch, stocks with a,==
		1. ==PEG ratio < 1 --> undervalued==
		2. ==PEG ratio = 1 --> fairly valued==
		3. ==PEG ratio > 1 --> over valued==
	- ==try looking for companies that's less than 1.4 or less.==
- capital employed turnover ratio
	- it indicates how efficiently the company utilizes its capital employed with reference to its sales. 
	- ==This ratio changes from industry to industry, so comparing a company with the average CET ratio of its sector (all its peers in that industry), proves to be a viable option. Look for a higher CET ratio than its industry.==
- increase in cash flow from operations
	- advantages of a strong cash flow 
		1. it can pay for ongoing expenses
		2. reduces the need for borrowing
		3. it supports the company to invest more towards its betterment

		- compare it with its peers in the industry
		- look for more than 67%
	2. Contingent liability as a % of net worth

	- breakeven sales as a percentage of actual sales
