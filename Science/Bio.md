Transcription is the process of converting dna to mrna

Mrna stores information and we can use that to synthesis protein and this process is called Translation 

Ribosome is the site of protein synthesis in the cell

# transcription 

## 1. Initiation 
During the initiation stage, the Rna polymerase binds itself to the promoter region of the dna. 

What is the promoter region?
It's just a short sequence of DNA and in eukaryotic dna, that would be TATAAA

## 2. Elongation 
The next thing that the polymerase does is it seperate the existing dna into two individual strands..

## 3. Termination 
The Rna polymerase molecule, mran (messenger rna) separates from the dna template strand
