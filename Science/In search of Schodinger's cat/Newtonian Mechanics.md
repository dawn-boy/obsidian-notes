# The Three Great Laws of Motion 
## 1. Law of Inertia 
An object remains at rest or continuous to move with constant [velocity](terminology#Velocity) in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force
- So, things don't stop their state of motion by themselves
- Force is required to start, stop, or change direction

## 2. Law of Force & Acceleration 
The rate of change of [momentum](terminology#momentum) of an object is directly proportional to the applied force and occurs in the direction of that force
$$Force = mass \times acceleration$$
- Greater force -> Greater Acceleration
- Greater mass -> Lesser acceleration for the same force

## 3. Law of Action and Reaction
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

meaning, 
- force always occur in pairs
- these forces act on different objects, not the same one.

# Light
In classical mechanics, Light is modeled either as **rays** or **waves**.
- Light is said to be massless and travels at finite speed. It does not obey Newton's laws directly.
## 1. Ray optics
#### Core assumptions
1. Light travels in straight lines in uniform media
2. Wavelength is very small compared to objects
3. Time of travel is minimized according to [Fermat's Principle of Least time](terminology#Fermat's%20Principle%20of%20Least%20time)
### (a) Rectilinear propagation
Light travels in straight lines in homogeneous media
### (b) Reflection
$$Angle\ of\ incidence = Angle\ of\ reflection$$
This can be derived using least-time principle, not forces.
### (c) Refraction (Snell's law)
$$n_1 sin\theta_1 = n_2sin\theta_2$$
where, refractive index $n = \frac{c}{v}$

## 2. Wave Optics
Here, Light is treated as a wave, not as particles.
#### Key properties
- [Interference](terminology#Interference)
- [Diffraction](terminology#Diffraction)
- [Polarization](terminology#Polarization)
These phenomenon cannot be explained by ray optics.
#### Wave equation
$$∇^2E−\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0$$
###### Explanation
1. What is $E$ here?
	It's a field spread out. A value at every point in space and time.

2. What is a wave equation?
	General wave equation looks like (for anything that waves)$$(space\ curvature)\ =\ (time\ curvature)$$
	- If something bends in space,
	- it must evolve with time in a specific way
	This same structure appears for
	- waves on a string
	- Sound waves
	- Water waves
	- Light waves

3. What does Each term mean?
- $∇^2E$  talks about *spatial bending*
	it tells us how much the electric field curves or spreads out in space and this curvature propagates outward.
	- Kind of like, 
		- A bump on a rope
		- A ripple on water
- $\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$  talks about *time acceleration*
	it tells us how fast the field changes with time. Same role as acceleration in mechanics but for a field, not a particle.
- $\frac{1}{c^2}$ sets the speed of propagation. This speed turns out to be the speed of light.

So, the equation says *==if the electric field bends in space, that bending must move through space as a wave at speed c*==. And this moving disturbance is **Light**.
##### Relation to classical mechanics
Optics is *Classical* but not **Mechanical**
- No mass meaning $F = m \times a$ equation breaks
- Motion governed by [variational principles](terminology#Variational%20principles), not forces
- Energy and momentum exists but differently

Classical mechanics fails when
- wavelength comparable to system size
- Photoelectric effect
- Atomic spectra
These require **==Quantum Mechanics==**
