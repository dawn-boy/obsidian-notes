## Speed
a scalar quantity (only magnitude) that refers to how fast an object is moving.
$$speed = \frac{distance}{time}$$
## Velocity
a vector quantity (magnitude & direction) that says how fast an object is moving in a specific direction.
$$velocity= \frac{displacement}{time}$$
## Acceleration
a vector quantity that says the rate of which an object's velocity changes over time
$$acceleration= \frac{force}{mass}$$
## Momentum
its a measurement of *mass in motion*. It describes how much mass an object possesses and how difficult it'll be to bring it to a stop.
$$momentum= mass \times velocity$$
## Fermat's Principle of Least time
Light follows the path that takes extremely minimum time 
## Interference
Interference happens when two or more waves overlap and combine, following the superposition principle. This can increase or decrease the resultant amplitude
- Constructive Interference
	waves meet in-phase giving brighter fringes (higher intensity)
- Destructive interference
	waves meet out of phase giving darker fringes (low or zero intensity)
Young's double slit experiment is a classic example where two coherent light sources producing alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen.
## Diffraction
Diffraction is the bending and spreading of waves when they pass through a narrow opening or around an obstacle, especially when the size of comparable to the wavelength
- a single slit or edge produces a central bright maximum with weaker side fringes due to interference between different parts of the same wavelength.
Diffraction is why optical instruments have finite resolving power and why shard shadows are not perfectly sharp.
## Polarization
Polarization describes the orientation of electric field oscillation in a transverse wave like light. 
Unpolarized light has electric fields in many random direction.
- Polarized light has a preferred direction of oscillation (linear, circular, elliptical).
