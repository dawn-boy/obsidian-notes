To view the ip address of arch linux system
```bash
ip a
```

This address of ipv4 and ipv6 are in the inet and inet6 rows.

## Address classes

| Class    | IP address range              | Network mask  |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| A        | 10.0.0.0                      | 255.0.0.0     |
| B        | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0       | 255.255.0.0   |
| C        | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 |
| loopback | 127.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.7         | 255.255.255.0 |
- ipv4 and ipv6, IP addresses as a whole comes under layer 3
## MAC address
- this comes under layer 2
- the mac address can also be found by "ip a" command, its listed under ether/link 
- first three values of the mac address are called the identifiers, they can be used to identify the device manufacture

## The three-way handshake
![[Networking_1.png]]

- Whenever the client needs to communicate with a server, it sends out a SYN packet, 
- If the server is ready, it will respond with an SYN/ACK packet
- And finally the client too acknowledges by sending the ACK packet and thus a connection is formed.
## Common ports
### TCP ports

- FTP - 21
	allows for file transfer.
- SSH - 22
	same as Telnet but encrypted.
- Telnet - 23
	allows for remote connection.
- SMTP - 25
- DNS - 53
- HTTP - 80
- HTTPs - 443
- POP3 - 110
- SMB - 139 + 445
	file sharing stuffs. original port was 139 but recent windows versions use 445.
- IMAP 143
### UDP ports
- DNS - 53
- DHCP - 67, 68
	assigns dynamic IP addressl
- TFTP - 69
	file sharing using UDP.
- SNMP - 161

## TCP model

1. Physical layer
	Data cables
2. Data-link layer
	Switching, routers, MAC addresses
3. Network layer
	IP address, routing
4. Transport layer
	TCP/UDP
5. Session layer
	session management
6. Presentation layer
	MP4, WAV, WMV
7. Application layer
	HTTPs, HTTP, SMTP

## subnetting

![[Networking_3.png]]
- the CIDR is the number of bits the IP address takes up
- the subnet mask says which part of the address is the address itself and which part is the host
- to find the total number of hosts that a subnet can accommodate from a CIDR address bits, do 
$$(2^{\text{32 - CIDR address bits }}) - 2$$
- we subtract 2 because of the  broadcast ID and the network ID
- usually, network ID will be x.x.x.0 and broadcast ID will be x.x.x.255, if its a x.x.x.x/24 address.
