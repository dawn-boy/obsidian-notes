# The Robot Exclusion Protocol
website devs use /robots.txt file to give instructions about their site to the web robots. The robot visits the site's url (www.example.com/welcome.html), but before it does so, it checks for the www.example.com/robots.txt file.

If it's available, 
```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

User-agent: *  --> this section says that it's applicable to all robots
Disallow: /       --> This says that the robot is not supposed to visit any pages on the website.

### keep in mind:
- Robots can just ignore your robots.txt file, if it's programmed that way,
- and /robots.txt file is publicly available, so it's a sign saying "There are Treasures here! Do not try to break in."
Better just don't use em.
