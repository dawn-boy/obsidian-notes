# The Robot Exclusion Protocol
website devs use /robots.txt file to give instructions about their site to the web robots. The robot visits the site's url (www.example.com/welcome.html), but before it does so, it checks for the www.example.com/robots.txt file.

If it's available, 
```text
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

User-agent: *  --> this section says that it's applicable to all robots
Disallow: /       --> This says that the robot is not supposed to visit any pages on the website.

keep in mind:
- Robots can just ignore your robots.txt file, if it's programmed that way,
- and /robots.txt file is publicly available, so it's a big red flag saying "There are Treasures here! Do not try to break in."
	Better just don't use em.

### php - directory traversal attack
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home
in this url, we can substitute some other value for page and fetch it's content.
eg: 
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/passwd
will fetch all the users in the system
### php - passthru function
passthru function allows for command execution, the websites that use it to receive user input can also receive commands which hackers can exploit. 
entering ; command will execute the command.
