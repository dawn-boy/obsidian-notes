tuut ruu# ssh
ssh is a program used for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on it. It usually gives a secure encrypted communication between the two insecure or untrusted points, if configured properly.
- ==other services running on different ports can use ssh to tunnel their data securely.==
#### To connect with ssh
```sh
ssh -p port_number -l username destination_URL
```
# find
this finds files really..
```sh
find -user owner -group owningGroup -iname incaseSensitiveNamePattern 2> /dev/null -size {bytes}c
```
# strings
This prints all the printable characters in the file content (ignores all the binary stuffs)
```sh
string fileName
```

# sort
this sorts the file lines (numerically first, then alphabetically)
```sh
sort fileName
```
# uniq
this prints the unique line within the file, to use it properly first sort the file contents
```sh
uniq -u
```
# tr
this just transforms each letters to the other given letter
```sh
tr '[a-z]' '[m-za-l]'
```
# gzip2
decompress a .gz file
```sh
gzip2 -d file.gz
```
# tar
extracts .tar files
```sh
tar --extract -f file
```
# xxd
can revert hex dumps 
```sh
xxd -r file
```
# file
can tell you what type of file it is. ==(really useful for forensics)==
```sh
file filename
```

# Ssh login using private keys
- the server must have .ssh folder set up with '600' rights, and it should host the 'authorized_keys' file containing the public key.
- the client should also have a .ssh folder in it's home directory and the private key renamed as 'id_rsa'. The fill should be setup with proper permissions, or else ssh-ing with a these keys won't work. my 'id_rsa' file has 600 permission
# to login with tls/ssl on some port 
```sh
opessl s_client host:port
```
# to copy some file from remote server
```shell
scp -P port username@host:file_path .
```
# to just view the file on some remote ssh server
```sh
ssh -p port -l username hostAddr "cat file_name"
```

*** 
# To create a connection between two ports within the localhost
```sh
# in one terminal type
nc -l localhost 1234

# in another type,
nc -N localhost 1234
# Now both are connected and any message sent from one to print in the other

# to feed lots of inputs to the nc shell
cat keys | nc localhost 1234

```

# to see what shell the current user is running
```sh
cat /etc/passwd

# if you ssh and the user is using someother shell, Try to get into vim mode and from there you can change the shell with
/set shell=/bin/bash
:terminal

# when the window is too small to display text, more will get into interact mode, from there getting into vim mode is just pressing 'v'
```
