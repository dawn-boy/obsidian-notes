## chemical or biochemical sensor
- it consists of a recognition element coupled with transducer element
- components 
	- biological recognition element 
		enzymes, nucleotides, any biological matter that interacts with the analyte
	- transducer 
		converts biological interaction into a measurable signal. it can be electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric, or thermal 
	- signal processor
		- amplifies and process the signal for further analysis 
- types
	- based on biological recognition element 
		- enzymatic sensors
		- immuno sensors
		- dna sensors
		- cell based sensors
	- based on transduction method 
		- electrochemical sensor 
		- optical sensor 
		- piezoelectric 
		- thermal 
- working 
	- Recognition: the analyte binds to the biological recognition element 
	- Transduction: the binding event casus a change in the transducer that converts biological interaction into a detectable signal
	- Signal processing: signal is amplified, processed, and converted into a readable form
- electrochemical sensor 
	- potentiometeric sensor - voltage
	- amperometric sensor - current
	- conductometric sensor -  change in conductivity 
	- commonly used in glucose monitoring 
- optical biosensors
	- detects changes in light properties due to the interaction between analyte and biological recognition element 
	- surface plasmon resonance 
	- flouroscence based sensors 
	- ex: medical diagnostics, 
- piezoelectric biosensors 
	- these sensors detect mechanical change, such as mass variation or acoustic wave propagation, resulting from the interaction between the analyte and the recognition element 
- thermal biosensors 
	- measures the change in temperature 
- application of biochemical sensors
	- medical diagnostics 
	- environmental monitoring 
	- food safety
	- biotechnology 
- advantages
	- high sensitivity 
	- rapid and real time analysis 
	- portability 
- challenges
	- stability of bio recognition element 
	- cost and complexity 
	- integration of electronic elements 
- analysis of gold standard fluids
	- sweat - sodium, chloride present as biomarkers
	- saliva - sodium and chloride 
	- breath - gas chromatography 
	- tears - glucose is a biomarker

## system design 
- sample handling 
	- micro fluid systems deals with micro volumes of the target samples to generate the same information as standard procedures
	- smaller sample body helps by
		- reducing the size and so improving the reliability of fluid handling system 
		- incorporates active sensing area inside 
		- reducing delay between sample and analysis 
- micro needle technology 
	- a minimal invasive way
	- wearable as a small devices 
	- used for fluid extraction 
	- glucose level is monitored
- colourimetric sensing platforms
	- involves color change at active sensor surface
	- used for clinical diagnostic and environmental sensing 
	- used in contact lens to measure glucose level in tears
- challenges in biochemical sensing 
	- sensor stability 
	- interface with the body
	- textile integration
	- power requirement

## atrial fibrillation
- a common type, caused by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses of the heart
- AF can lead to stroke and heart failure
- higher chance in elders
- AF can be diagnosed from ECG
## Coronary artery atherosclerosis
- coronary heart disease (CHD) is caused by blockages of blood vessels of the heart resulting in chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart
- with uncontrolled blockage, parts of the heart may die
- CHD may lead to sudden deaths as a result of rupture
- major risk factors of CHD includes age, high BP, smoking and diabetes
## Peripheral arteries disease
- it is a slowly progressive disease mainly due to atherosclerosis and further affects the vessels such as aorta and other arteries
- PAD can lead to CAD, stroke, or even death
- major risk factor s are hypertension, smoking and diabetes
- as technology is becoming mature, it is possible to build wearable systems for diagnosis of PAD
