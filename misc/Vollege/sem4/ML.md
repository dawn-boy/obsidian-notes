# intelligence
its the ability to interact with the world. It's the ability to learn and adapt

- ## Artificial intelligence 
	An ability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior 
	
	- ## Machine learning 
		An application of Artificial intelligence that provides the system to automatically learn and improve from new experiences
	
		- ## Deep learning
			An application of machine learning that uses complex algorithms and deep neural networks to train a model

## types of machine learning
### 1. Supervised
- trained with pre-labelled data to predict new outcomes
- makes machine learn explicitly
- direct feedback is given
- predicts future outcomes
- ==resolves classification and regression problems==
### 2. Unsupervised
- Non-labelled data that is self-organised by the algorithm to predict new outcomes
- machine understands the data and tries to identify patterns 
### 3. Reinforcement
- feedback to algorithm when it does something right or wrong
- reward based learning
- aim of this learning is to maximize rewards 
## Machine learning tasks
It's the type of prediction or inference being made, based on the problem or question and the available data

1. Binary classification
	- supervised learning task
	- predicts which of the two classes the given data belongs to
2. Multiclass classification 
	 - supervised learning task
	 - predicts which class the given data belongs to. 
	 - there's often multiple classes 
3. Regression
	- supervised learning task 
	- predicts the value of a label from a given set of features
	- it models the dependency of label on its related features to determine how the label will change as the values of the features are varied
4. Clustering
	 - unsupervised learning task
	 - it is used to group similar data into clusters and to find common patters
5. Ranking
	 - supervised learning task
	 - it constructs a ranker based on the given set of labeled examples
	 - it can then predict the score for a new data
6. Anomaly detection
	- it looks for co-relation among variables and determines the combination of values that best captures the differences in the outcomes 
7. Forecasting
	- supervised learning task 
	 - uses past time-series data to predict future outcomes  
## Model types
### Geometric models
- constructed directly in instance space using geometric concepts like line, planes and distances
- models that define similarity by considering the geometry of the instance space
### Probabilistic model
### Logical model
