==The Document containing laws and rules which determine and describe the form of the government, the relationship between the citizens and the government is called the Constitution. ==

- almost everything we do is govern by a set of rules
- some rules are made by legislature, in India its Lok sabha and Rajya sabha, and these rules are called as Laws
- Laws are made to protect us and our property and to ensure that everyone in the society behaves freely in a way that does not affect another individual
- Laws also tells us the consequence of our actions
- The constitution is the Supreme Law of the land and all other laws need to conform to the constitution. It is a set of principles according to which a state is governed.
- The Constitution contains laws concerning the government and its relationship with its people
- The constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain its government.
- A constitution is concerned with 2 main aspects,
	- The relation between different levels of government. 
		- Legislature, makes the law
		- Judiciary, Interprets the law
		- Executive, enforces the law
	- The relation between government and the citizens.
- All 3 organs of the government and the people derive their power and authority, that is fundamental right, from the constitution. If they act against it, its called unconstitutional or unlawful. So a constitution is required to have authoritive allocation of power and function to a body and to restrict them within its limit.
- Originally, the constitution had a preamble, 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules
- Currently, it has a preamble, 448 articles in 25 parts and 12 schedules
