- probability of an impossible event is 0
## axioms

$$ 0 \le P(A) \le 1 $$
$$P(A) > 0$$
$$\sum p(A) = 1$$
- classic probability is determined by 
- $$P(A) = \frac{num\ of\ fav.\ outcomes}{num\ of\ outcomes} = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$
- probability of non-occurrence 
$$P(\overline{A}) = 1-P(A)$$

## types of event
- mutually exclusive: 
	two or more events that cannot occur simultaneously
- addition rule
$$P(A\ or\ B) = P(A\ \bigcup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\ \cap B)$$
 - Independent events
	 two or more events are said to be independent if and only if, A and B are occurring simultaneously
$$ P(A\ \bigcap\ B) = P(A) * P(B)$$
$$P(A\ \bigcup\ B) = 0$$
- multiplication rule
	$$P(A\ and\ B) = P(A\ \cap\ B) = P(A) * P(B)$$
