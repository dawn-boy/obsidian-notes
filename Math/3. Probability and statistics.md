- probability of an impossible event is 0
## axioms

$$ 0 \le P(A) \le 1 $$
$$P(A) > 0$$
$$\sum p(A) = 1$$
- classic probability is determined by 
- $$P(A) = \frac{num\ of\ fav.\ outcomes}{num\ of\ outcomes} = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$
- probability of non-occurrence 
$$P(\overline{A}) = 1-P(A)$$

## types of event
- mutually exclusive: 
	two or more events that cannot occur simultaneously
- addition rule
$$P(A\ or\ B) = P(A\ \bigcup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\ \cap B)$$
 - Independent events
	 two or more events are said to be independent if and only if, A and B are occurring simultaneously
$$ P(A\ \bigcap\ B) = P(A) * P(B)$$
$$P(A\ \bigcup\ B) = 0$$
- multiplication rule
	$$P(A\ and\ B) = P(A\ \cap\ B) = P(A) * P(B)$$

## binomial distributions

if x is a discrete random variable is said to follow binomial distributions, then its probability density function is 
$$P(X=x) = nC_xp^xq^{n-x}$$
where x are positive values and it represents number of success in trials.
$$p + q = 1$$
$$Mean\ E(x) = np$$
$$Variance\ V(x) = npq$$
$$Standard\ deviation\ SD(x) = \sqrt{npq}$$


***
commonly used measures are,
- mean
- median
- mode
- geometric mean
- harmonic mean

### Mean
##### for discrete series
$$Mean = \frac{\sum x}{n}, \ where\ n=\ sample\ size$$
##### for continuous series
$$Mean = \frac{\sum fx}{N},\ where\ N = freq\ total$$
### Median
##### for discrete series
- arrange the data in ascending order and calculate cumulative frequency
- if the number of data is odd, take the middle value
- if the number of data is even, take the average of 2 middle values
##### for continuous series
$$l + [\frac{N/2 -m}{f}] * c$$
- l -> lower limit
- c -> class interval
- f -> frequency
- m -> precedency value of cf

### Mode
##### for discrete series
just take the most repeated value
##### for continuous series
$$l + [\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1-f_0-f_2}]$$
### Geometric mean
$$GM = (X_i)^{1/x}$$
### Harmonic mean
$$HM = \frac{n}{\sum 1/x_i} $$
# note
if interval is given instead of x, then take the middle value of the interval and use it as x.

## Time Series
it establishes a relation between cause and effect.
- secular trend - the increase and decrease in the movement of the time series
	- graphic method
		just plot the graph and draw the trend line
	- MAM (moving average method)
		- to find the moving average add consecutive elements and divide by the number of elements added.
		- to find the central average of the moving average, add two consecutive elements and divide by 2.
	- semi-average method
	- method of least square

## Correlation

- the degree of relation between two variables
- it is expressed as -1 <= r <= 1
- the direction of change is indicated by sign
## types of correlation
1. positive correlation
	- if the change is in the same direction
2. negative correlation
	- if the change is in the opposite direction 
### formula
$$r = \frac{\sum xy}{\sum x^2y^2}$$
$$x = x - \overline{x}$$
$$y = y - \overline{y}$$
### properties
- the co-efficient correlation is always between -1 and 1
- independent of change of origin and scale
